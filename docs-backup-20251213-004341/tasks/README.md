# Implementation Tasks

This section contains detailed reports and documentation for implementation tasks completed during the Stitch platform development.

## Task Organization

Tasks are organized chronologically by task number ranges:

### Early Implementation (Tasks 01-10)
Core system foundation and critical fixes:

- **TASK_02_VERIFICATION.md** - Initial system verification

- **TASK_07_VERIFICATION.md** - Authentication system
- **TASK_08_VERIFICATION.md** - Workflow execution
- **TASK_09_VERIFICATION.md** - Error handling
- **TASK_10_VERIFICATION.md** - Performance validation
- **fix-state-status.md** - Node state transition fixes
- **prefix-inconsistency-fix.md** - Variable naming consistency

### Mid Implementation (Tasks 11-20)

## Implementation Patterns

Each task follows a consistent structure:
- **Problem Statement**: What issue or feature is being addressed
- **Implementation Details**: Technical approach and changes made
- **Files Modified**: Specific files and components affected
- **Testing**: Verification and validation approaches
- **Impact**: How the change affects the system
- **Next Steps**: Future work or follow-up tasks
