# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation that is no longer actively maintained but preserved for reference.

## What's Archived

### Tasks (archive/tasks/)
Historical implementation task reports from the early development phases (Tasks 1-27). These documents were point-in-time reports of implementation work.

**Current task tracking:** See `/specs/[number]/progress/` for ongoing task summaries.

**Value:** Understanding how the system evolved, implementation decisions, and historical context.

### Reports (archive/reports/)
Point-in-time status reports, checkpoint summaries, and project documentation snapshots.

**Current status:** See `/specs/` for current implementation status and `/quality/reviews/` for recent reviews.

**Value:** Historical project state, milestone documentation, implementation summaries.

### Implementation (archive/implementation/)
Detailed implementation documentation snapshots including API docs, backend systems, and frontend components.

**Current documentation:** See `/specs/` for current feature documentation and `/architecture/` for system design.

**Value:** Historical implementation details, evolution of the codebase, architectural decisions.

### Features (archive/features/)
Historical feature-specific documentation that has been consolidated into specs.

**Current documentation:** See `/specs/[number]/reference/` for feature documentation.

**Value:** Historical feature development context, early design decisions.

### Development Working (archive/development/working/)
Working documents and drafts that have been moved to appropriate specs.

**Current location:** See corresponding spec directories for finalized documentation.

**Value:** Development process insights, early design explorations.

## Using Archived Documents

Archived documents are:
- **Read-only:** Not actively maintained
- **Historical:** Reflect state at time of writing
- **Reference:** Useful for understanding evolution
- **Searchable:** Can be searched for historical context

## When to Archive

Documents should be archived when:
1. They are point-in-time snapshots (not living docs)
2. They have been superseded by newer documentation
3. They are no longer part of active development
4. They provide historical value but clutter active docs
