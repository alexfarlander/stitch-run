## Notes

This spec addresses Phase 5 from the REFACTOR_ROADMAP.md which focuses on three key observability milestones:

- Journey Timeline functionality
- Dashboard navigation and analytics

The goal is to make existing observability components accessible to users and ensure they work with real workflow data.
